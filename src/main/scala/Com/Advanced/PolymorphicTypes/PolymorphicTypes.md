# parametric Polymorphism
We specify a function with a generic parameter, then, when we instantiate that function or whatever, 
we specify our current type, which then gets applied to the function.

# Ad-Hoc Polymorphism
With ad hoc polymorphism, we can actually change the behavior of the generic code based on the type we polymorph

# F-bounded polymorphism

what if you want to design generic trait that have a concrete subclass that you want 
to access it ??

like having a generic trait wanted to be compared to particular subclass of that trait
